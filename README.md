# Question_Answering_AI
AI2 Reasoning Challenge (ARC) 2018 Multiple-choice science questions The dataset is partitioned into a Challenge Set and an Easy Set Where the former contains only questions answered incorrectly by both a retrieval-based algorithm and a word co-occurrence algorithm Each question has a multiple choice structure (typically 4 answer options Challenge Set  - 2,590 “hard” questions (those that both a retrieval and a co-occurrence method fail to answer correctly)  Easy Set of 5,197 questions. Each are pre-split into Train, Development, and Test sets as follows: Challenge Train: 1,119 Challenge Dev: 299 Challenge Test: 1,172 Easy Train: 2,251 Easy Dev: 570 Easy Test: 2,376 Available Dataset - over 14 million science sentences relevant to the task Note that use of the corpus for the Challenge is completely optional, and also that systems are not restricted to this corpus. Please see the README included in the download for additional information and terms of use of this corpus. Available Models - an implementation of three neural baseline models for this dataset.
